# Connect DocBrowser module

## Installing source version

1. Create or use an existing DNN installation on your dev machine
2. Install the latest \_Install.zip file from the releases - this will run the SQL scripts necessary
3. Go to DesktopModules/MVC/Connect
4. Delete the DocBrowser folder
5. Git clone https://github.com/DNN-Connect/DocBrowser.git here (i.e. DesktopModules/MVC/Connect)
6. That should put the DocBrowser folder back
7. Switch to that folder and run yarn

### Developing

I use VS Code for the front-end and VS Community for all cs stuff.
